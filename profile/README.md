# Saying goodbye to PHP

Hi, I'm Erin. If you're reading this you're probably using one or more of my
open-source PHP repositories (most likely from the [Eloquent] GitHub
organization). I'm writing this to let you know that I've decided to stop 
supporting all of my PHP packages. I will soon begin the process of deprecating 
them.

At the time I started working on these projects, I was a PHP developer. I used
the projects I was working on in my day job, and my work was even flexible 
enough to allow me to work on them during work hours. As a result, the projects
were well-maintained and I was able to provide support to those using them.

However, the reality is that it's been the better part of a decade since my day
job involved PHP. A lot of my PHP packages need to be updated to support newer
versions of PHP, and I simply don't have the motivation to do that. I'd rather
be spending my time working on projects that I might actually use.

If this affects you in any way, all I can do is apologize. In the spirit of open
source, you're always free to fork and modify my work, and I'd encourage anyone
to do so if you were relying heavily on my packages.

Thanks for your understanding.

â€” Erin
